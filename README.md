**LVGL StellarBridge** is a project that turns a compact embedded system into a **portable, intelligent network bridge**.  
It combines **network address translation (NAT)**, a **web-based control panel**, and a **futuristic graphical display** ‚Äî creating a self-contained system that feels like a gateway from another world.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Network Bridging with NAT**
  - Connects to an upstream Wi-Fi network (Station mode).
  - Creates its own Wi-Fi Access Point for clients.
  - Clients access the internet transparently through NAT.

- **Web Configuration Interface**
  - Configure SSID, password, and NAT settings.
  - Scan and select nearby networks.
  - Over-the-air (OTA) firmware update support.
  - Monitor connected clients.

- **Futuristic Display UI (LVGL)**
  - Real-time Wi-Fi signal strength indicators.
  - Battery monitoring & charging icons.
  - Animated sci-fi style hotspot and status logos.

- **System Management**
  - Hardware button input (e.g., power/display control).
  - Scheduled restart and keep-alive timers.
  - Persistent configuration via NVS.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- ESP-IDF v5.x (tested)
- LVGL v9.x
- Wi-Fi network for STA connection

### Build & Flash
```bash
idf.py set-target esp32
idf.py menuconfig   # (configure Wi-Fi, NAT options, LVGL if needed)
idf.py build
idf.py flash monitor
First Use
